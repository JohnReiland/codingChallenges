/*
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one
sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are count1 and count2
respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to
count1 + count2) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], count1 = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], count2 = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], count1 = 1, nums2 = [], count2 = 0
Output: [1]

Constraints:
0 <= count1, count2 <= 200
1 <= count1 + count2 <= 200
nums1.length == count1 + count2
nums2.length == count2
-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9
*/

const merge = (nums1, count1, nums2, count2) => {};

module.exports = { merge };
